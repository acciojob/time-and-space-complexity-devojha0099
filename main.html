		<h2>Time complexity</h2>
		<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input.
			It helps us understand how an algorithm's performance scales and allows us to compare different approaches to solving the same problem.
			An algorithm with lower time complexity is generally more efficient, meaning it can handle larger inputs more quickly. By analyzing time
			complexity, developers can choose the most efficient solutions, ensuring better performance in real-world applications.

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h2>Space Complexity</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input. It includes the space needed for input storage,
			temporary variables, and the call stack during execution. For example, an algorithm that stores all input elements in an array would typically
			have a <span>space complexity</span> of O(n), where 'n' represents the number of elements. Understanding <span>space complexity</span> is crucial for writing efficient programs,
			especially in environments with limited memory resources.
